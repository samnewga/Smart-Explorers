Inspiration:
The idea for this project came from  a Genetic Algorithm called Smart Rockets.
                 
Description: 
Using PyGame to show a visual representation of math equations and random activities  to navigate through a course 
with obstacles in order to get to the final destination.The A.I. learns to navigate through the course using a DNA like 
storing/reproducing method. A failed attempt will be forgotten, while a attempt that was either successful or closer to the goal  
will be stored in the gene pool. The gene pool will allow for pairing/reproduction. This gene pool prioritizes the most successful 
attempts for the pairing process.There are a total of 5 levels, each getting more difficult for the explorers to navigate.
In order for the explorers to move on to the next stage, 1/3 of them must succesfully navigate through the course.

How to use: 
Step 1: Navigate through all the menu options to learn about the project.
Step 2: Press the Run button(light blue) to run the program.
Step 3: Let the program run(There is a total of 5 missions).
Step 4: Close program when done viewing.

Legend:
Frame = Number of moves take/allowed.
Generation = Number of attempts for that stage.
Explorers Alive = Number of explorers that are still alive.
Last Generation = Stats from the last attempt  compared to the current.
Total Explorers = The number of explorers generated.
Successful Explorers = Number of explorers that reached the goal.
Fitness = Success rate.
Fastest Time = Fastest explorer to reach the goal.
